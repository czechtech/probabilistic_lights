# Probabilistic Lights (microbit)

Pressing the 'A' key or 'B' button will turn on the corresponding lights.  And, when both keys are pressed at the same time both sets of lights turn on.

If the lights are turned on together enough times, they'll *LEARN* to both turn on at the same time even if only 1 of the buttons is pressed!

However, after only 1 key is used by itself enough times the lights will go back to turning on separately.

This code is to be run on a Micro:bit pocket-sized computer:
